## Overview:
A suite of general MATLAB scripts.

## Contents:
- `Machine Precision`. (_Machine Epsilon_)
- `Box-Muller method`.

## Note:
Dear reader,

This is simply a repository containing a collection of useful MATLAB scripts I have developed during my time on the MSc Computational Finance course at UCL. I have tried my best to make them as simple as possible with plenty of comments explaining the rationale behind certain steps â€“ mostly for my own benefit to remind myself in the future. I do not claim them to be perfect, nor are they necessarily the most efficient way of doing things. 

I hope they provide as much help to you as they did to me.
