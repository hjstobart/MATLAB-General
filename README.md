# MATLAB-General
A repository to include a suite of general MATLAB scripts.

Dear reader,

I have created this repository as an online place for me to store various MATLAB scripts that I have developed during my time on the course MSc Computational Finance at UCL.

I have tried my best to make them as simple as possible with plenty of comments explaining the rationale behind certain steps â€“ mostly for my own benefit as an easy way to remind myself how I did things.

I do not claim them to be perfect, nor are they necessarily the best or most efficient way of doing things. They simply show the approach I took at the time with the knowledge I had at the time.

Anyway, I hope they serve some purpose for whoever may stumble across them.

ðŸ–– Live long and prosper. H
