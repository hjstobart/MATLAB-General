## MATLAB â€“ General

__===== *This repository and the code contained therein may be freely copied and distributed as necessary.* =====__

### Overview:
A suite of general MATLAB scripts.

### Preface:
Dear reader,

This is simply a repository containing a collection of useful MATLAB scripts I have developed during my time on the MSc Computational Finance course at UCL. I have tried my best to make them as simple as possible with plenty of comments explaining the rationale behind certain steps â€“ mostly for my own benefit to remind myself in the future. I do not claim them to be perfect, nor are they necessarily the most efficient way of doing things. 

I hope they provide as much help to you as they did to me in writing them. 

Live long and prosper. H ðŸ–– 

### Contents:
